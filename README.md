# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis with KMeans 

In this project, we will analyze and segment the customers of an e-commerce company by using the RFM approach with KMeans.This will enable the company to optimize their retention and acquisition strategies.

Customer Segmentation is the process of splitting a customer base into groups according to its similarity.This concept of similarity depends on common characteristics - such as demographics(e.g, age, gender, income) or transactional behaviours(e.g, spending amount, quantity of purchases, days since last purchase).

RFM Analysis is a basic customer segmentation algorithm used to identify company's best customers by measuring and analyzing spending habits.This model is based on three main variables:
1. Recency : How recently a customer made purchase(i.e, if you bought something on August 10th and today is August 19th, your recency is 9 days).
2. Frequency : How often customers make a purchse(i.e, if you made 6 purchases during a specific time interval of analysis, your frequency is 6).
3. Monetary : How much money a customer spends on purchases(i.e, if you buy 4 products priced at $10 each, then your monetary value is $40).

These variables are relevant indictors of customer's behaviour because frequency and monetary value affects their lifetime value, and recency affects retention.

However, we will use RFM Analysis approach with an Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm called KMeans.

KMeans is a clustering algorithm which divides a dataset into k clusters, where k is defined a priori. Each cluster refers to a collection of data(in this case customers) aggregated together because of certain similarities.

In this project we will group similar observations together(in k clusters) and discover underlying patterns.
